	How to heat water in some seconds
</div>
<ol>
	<li> Moving up from sea level, the air gets thinner and thinner. With fewer air molecules to push the water down, each water molecule has an easier time breaking away from the others and entering the air. In other words, it takes less heat to get the water boiling. The water will boil sooner, but the low temperature will make it harder to cook food.</li>
	<li>Since liquids evaporate faster at higher altitudes you should also add a little extra water to compensate. If you're planning to cook food in the water, you should add even more water. The food will require a longer cooking time, so more water than you're used to will boil away.
	</li>
	<li>To make up for the lower temperature, you can cook the food for a longer amount of time. Here's a simple rule for how much time to add
	<ol>
		<li>dont eat too much water</li>

Consider using a pressure cooker. At especially high altitudes, cooking in boiling water can take an unreasonably long time. Boil water a pressure cooker instead. This traps the water under an airtight lid, and raises the pressure so the water can reach higher temperatures. In a pressure cooker, you can follow the recipe as though you were cooking at sea level
