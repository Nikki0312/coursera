	How to heat water in some seconds
</div>
<ol>
	<li> Moving up from sea level, the air gets thinner and thinner. With fewer air molecules to push the water down, each water molecule has an easier time breaking away from the others and entering the air.</li>
	<li>Since liquids evaporate faster at higher altitudes you should also add a little extra water to compensate.
	</li>
	<li>To make up for the lower temperature, you can cook the food for a longer amount of time.
	<ol>
		<li>dont eat too much water</li>

	<li>
Consider using a pressure cooker. At especially high altitudes, cooking in boiling water can take an unreasonably long time. Boil water a pressure cooker instead.
